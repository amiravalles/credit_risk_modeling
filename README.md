# credit_risk_modeling
Credit risk modeling project: building a PD (Probability of Default) model, a LGD (Loss Given Default) model, and an EAD (Exposure at Default) model.
All of the models will be developed using regression models:
* PD -> Logistic Regression: to predict wether the borrower defaulted or not.
* LGD -> Beta Regression: to predict how much of the loan was recovered after default.
* EAD -> Beta Regression: to predict the total exposure at the mooment the borrower defaulted, compared to the total exposure in the past.
